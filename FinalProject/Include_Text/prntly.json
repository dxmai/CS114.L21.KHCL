Up into the beginning of the 1800, industry and jobs boomed in the state. Between 1820-1920, New York lead the world in manufacturing. Through the 1800s it had the largest state population in the United States. Up until 1925 it was the most populated city on the planet Earth.  The state\u2019s first governor, small government proponent and Democratic-Republican George Clinton, would also be it\u2019s longest serving one at 7 terms, setting the groundwork for a Empirical success story. Hundreds of universities were built in the span of just a century. It had the most factories in the world. The largest population. The most prosperous and wealthy citizens. It produced more food and textiles and machinery than any other place on the planet. There was little government. Little government regulation. Few taxes. No income taxes. No public education system.  And yet it produced the world\u2019s smartest individuals by today\u2019s standards. And it was safe. From Staten Island to Niagara Falls. The state was an Empire. And then it began to stray. New York\u2019s collapse is not a fast one. The effect of socialism are not overnight. Just as the effects of Capitalism are not always what you see, but what you don\u2019t see. It is the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d that Adam Smith would reference. New York had none of the problems it has today. There were no zoning laws, and people built businesses out of their homes that would go on to become world companies. The state collects billions in income tax dollars now, compared to $0 that were collected from the 1700s up until 1919. Now it collects more money than ever from it\u2019s remaining citizen\u2019s income, yet has more problems than ever. It spent nothing on public education for the first half of it\u2019s history as a colony and state. Now it spends the most in the country, yet New York\u2019s education system is in full collapse. Students leave school unable to be self-sustainable citizens, and crime is a rampant among young people throughout modern day New York. New York once lead the country in entrepreneurs. It now leads the country in heroin use.  There are few jobs today. New York\u2019s economic outlook was ranked the worst in the country by the end of 2020.

Since then, Malta has had a unique privilege of surviving. We suffered for hundreds of years as a human farm for the Berbers, specifically the North African slave harvester, Dragut. We lost thousands of Maltese to slavery, famine, disease, impressment, and indentured servitude. We are a small people as is; there\u2019s less than half a million actual ethnic Maltese in Malta.

The problem with this was that the government made on alcohol. lots of it. Sin tax was the single greatest generator of revenue for the federal government by 1900. And it made perfect sense. If you want to indulge in alcohol, you can fund public services for it. But banning alcohol would take away that revenue stream. So the temperance movement had the 16th amendment passed, which allowed the government to collect an income tax. by doing this, the prohibitionists now had an answer to anti prohibitionists who brought up the lost revenue; the government can replace it with taxation of income.

In Washington, a large rally of thousands rallied to support the Ayatollah and condemned the air strike against the Iranian Quds Forces Commander as he left Baghdad International Airport in Iraq last week. The White House said they had evidence he was planning attacks on the US embassy, and was behind the attempted takeover of the US embassy in Baghdad last week.In response, over 200 marches were planned by left wing activists across America.Jane Fonda spoke at a rally in DC yesterday as well, claiming \u201cwe\u2019re building an army.\u201d She then encouraged civil disobedience to the audience, and many protesters listened; 146 were arrested.Some anti war protesters attempted to raid the Trump Hotel in DC but were stopped by police.", "is_fake": 1},
