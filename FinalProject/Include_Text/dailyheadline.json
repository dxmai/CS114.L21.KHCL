As far back as the 1930s, the Soviet Union targeted the Democrat Party for infiltration. They were wildly successful during that time, especially in planting Soviet agents throughout the FDR administration. Those Soviet agents helped direct our war effort to save the USSR from the Nazis, wrote the founding document that formed the UN, created the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and saw to it that Mao\u2019s Communists would take over China.It only got better. Immediately following our victory in WW II, Soviet agents working in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, saw to it that the American military was directed to Communist and pro-Communist Germans in the reconstruction of Germany, while anti-Communist Germans were discredited. They also sought to ensure only pro-Mao OSS agents advanced in the Chinese theater of operations. In the critical time before Mao\u2019s Communists defeated Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Nationalists, Soviet agents in the Truman administration successfully prevented critical support from reaching Chiang.Senator Joseph McCarthy, who correctly identified Communists working in the U.S. government, was successfully discredited by a vigorous, Communist inspired campaign, aided by McCarthy\u2019s political and bureaucratic opponents. McCarthy may have been a flawed individual, but he would have received that same treatment if he was Mother Teresa. The notion that the U.S. government was saturated with Communists had to be stomped out, and the messenger made an example of. The long term consequence was a stifling of speech about Communism.
