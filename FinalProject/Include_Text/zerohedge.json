That 14bps curve flattening was a 2 standard deviation event going back to 1990, so it\u2019s safe to say moves like we saw last week are rare. In conjunction with the curve flattening, the cyclical/reflation trade was reversed in its tracks with banks and commodity related businesses selling off while long duration growth stocks caught a bid. Some, but not all of that has been reversed this week.  We wrote last week that that latter seemed more plausible since none of our indicators that point to turns in the economic or rates cycle have budged. In this post we\u2019ll focus more on the bond market and why, if anything, the curve is likely to unwind the flattening action that occurred last week.The composition of the move in the yield curve is significant. 2-year yields rose from 16bps to 25bps while 10-year yield fell more modestly from 149bps to 144bps. Currently, the 2-year sits even higher at 27bps while 10s are also higher at 154bps. The action in the yield curve last wek was the market interpreting the Fed\u2019s monetary policy announcement as a hawkish surprise that will cause shorter-term rates to rise. Rising short rates ultimately slow the economy and tamp down inflation, which is why longer-term yields fell.

Instead of rapidly escalating, so long as the consequences of inflation are contained as they have been since the early 1980s, non-fixed interest investments have been good inflation hedges. But what happens to asset prices if inflation is not contained and escalates?To answer this question, we must first define what we mean by contained inflation. Interest rates normally put a brake on the loss of a currency\u2019s purchasing power, limiting inflation to a cycle of credit. In other words, the market must be prepared to operate and allow interest rates to function as compensation for the consequences of monetary and credit inflation. Clearly, this condition does not apply today because central banks supress interest and bond rates as well as any evidence of the bank credit cycle. Furthermore, both foreign holders of a currency and its domestic users must be satisfied with monetary conditions to broadly retain their exposure to it. In the case of the dollar, which is the currency that really matters to us all, that has been undoubtedly true so far. But in these times of rising monetary inflation, there will come a point when the lack of interest compensation for currency debasement will begin to overtly undermine the dollar\u2019s purchasing power, and in the first instance this matters particularly to foreign holders.It is in this context that a deeper examination of the relationship between assets and the accelerated rate of issuance of state currencies is pertinent. That the rate of monetary expansion has accelerated is no secret; but so far, the probable effects on the purchasing power of the dollar, and also for other currencies aligned with it, have been ignored by investors. Central bankers have been coy on the subject, and by fiddling with the price inflation averages statisticians have buried the evidence. The suppression of the evidence on prices has been an important factor in what is effectively a concerted campaign of disinformation about inflation.While these conditions have built up for decades, so far, non-fixed interest asset values have still afforded protection for investors\u2019 capital. For the middle classes, the values of their homes, often geared through mortgage borrowing, have risen substantially. The values of their portfolios and pension plans have also benefited hugely. For them, these conditions have been extremely beneficial, which is why central banks have latched onto the wealth effect and are now directing new money into stock markets at unprecedented rates through quantitative easing.", "is_fake": 1},
