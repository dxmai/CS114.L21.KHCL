Some of the lounges were built inside a twenty-by-eight-foot steel shipping container finished in gleaming white paint, decorated with the brand\u2019s fluorescent-colored geometric patterns, and topped off with pink lounge furniture and a bar with brightly lit jewel boxes displaying the nicotine gadgets. After guests were handed a free Juul kit, they were invited to step in front of the Bosco animated \u201cGIF booth\u201d to have their pictures snapped and turned into silly moving videos designed to go viral on social media with an assortment of hashtags\u2014#juulmoment. #juullife. #juulpod. #juulvapor.As the sampling tour descended on yachts, raves, art shows, movie screenings, and wine tastings, Juul easily distributed hundreds of thousands of Juul pods. Company documents showed that the so-called Container Tour was expected to \u201cget JUUL into the hands of over 12,500 influencers subsequently introducing JUUL to over 1.5M people.\u201d Additionally, the marketing crew was encouraged to sign up people with their email addresses to help them spread brand awareness and to make them more likely to enlist in Juul\u2019s \u201cauto-ship\u201d program that delivered the product straight to the person\u2019s doorstep without their lifting a finger.Juul was following a well-worn formula that had come to define new tech start-ups. Rather than plow a bunch of money into a traditional, expensive Madison Avenue ad campaign on television and radio, it had become more effective to deploy the boundless reach of social media with the help of influencers. So-called user-generated content, which relied on real people posting about the product on Twitter or Instagram, had become the go-to tactic for start-ups to give a brand an air of authenticity and generate an x-factor that money couldn\u2019t buy. It had been done masterfully by insurgent brands. Juul\u2019s chief marketing officer, Richard Mumby, had previously worked at Bonobos, an upstart men\u2019s apparel brand that ran contests like the #Pantsformation challenge that had customers upload photos of themselves on Instagram for a chance to win a trip to New York City.
