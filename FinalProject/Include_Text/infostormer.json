Fortunately it is now much easier to learn the truth because of the immense volume of information that is accessible. It\u2019s a big reason why the Jews are doing everything in their power to restrict and limit the free flow of information on the Internet.In the early part of the 20th century, Germany had been ruined by Jews primarily through their orchestration of World War I. The Jews managed to convince Woodrow Wilson to bring the United States into the war which ultimately led to Germany\u2019s defeat. Wilson not surprisingly was also the same fool who signed the legislation that established the parasitical Jewish banking system known as the Federal Reserve in 1913. The British agreed to give Palestine over to the Jews via the Balfour declaration in exchange for bringing the Americans into the war.

Binge drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, drug use, homosexuality, race mixing and other weirdness have all been promoted as trendy and cool. They have promoted these things because they are ultimately destructive to us as a people. We need to reject this garbage.The Jews want us to be weak and they certainly do not want us to be strong. If we are to have a successful cultural revolution moving forward, we need to ensure that we take care of ourselves. We won\u2019t be able to defeat the Jews if our people are plagued with substance abuse problems. Strong men are what is needed to purge the Jew parasite from our nations. This is why I fully endorse and suggest that everyone maintain a straight edge lifestyle.The term \u201cstraight edge\u201d originated from a subculture of punk music to describe people who don\u2019t use drugs and alcohol. Specifically, the term was coined from a 46 second song released in 1981 by the punk band Minor Threat.
