Congress woman Ocasio-Cortez from New York was looking to make a big name for herself by taking on the CEO of Facebook. Her attempts however were fought off by her sheer lack of understanding of Facebook and how the world actually works.The congress woman in her questioning asked Zuckerburg about a wide variety of topics ranging from Facebook using what she deemed \u201d Far Right white supremacists groups\u201d to fact check, to asking if she could make up lies about Republicans in her up and coming Facebook campaign ads. She went so far as to ask if she could make up separate dates for Black voters to attend voting. Now why would a Democrat even want to raise such a question in the first place? Does she plan to stiffen her black voters in her tiny district of New York?Her attempt to paint Facebook as being in collusion with ultra white nationalists failed miserably too I might add. She mentioned that Facebook has begun using The Daily Caller as a independent fact checker to push back against the concern they were using only one sided stories. If you remember, at the beginning of their \u201cFact Checking\u201d, Facebook was using far left leaning Snopes. Yes Snopes, the website ran by a husband and wife along with their cat. The now broken up husband and wife, and I honestly have no idea who kept the cat. Let\u2019s continue, the Congresswoman called our friends over at the Daily caller \u201cFar right White supremacists\u201d in an attempt to pose the idea that Facebook is irresponsible, and in need of Government oversight to fact check. You and I know that the Daily Caller is not where the white supremacist go to get their news, or to fact check stuff they see on Facebook. After her big \u201chome-run\u201d, Ocasio-Cortez listened on as Zuckerburg informed on the inner workings of Facebook, and their fact checkers are now independent of the company. After this information was brought to light, you could almost see the steam rising from miss Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s ears as if a major thought was struggling to get out. She decided it was best to double down on her statement and again attempt to label Facebook as being in bed with white supremacists.", "is_fake": 1},

Abu has been known for years as the head of the now severely fractured death cult ISIS. Trump came on the main stream media to tell us and the world that the best military in the world went in and finally killed this coward Abu. The special forces unit was able to go in and take out the head of the snake without a single causality. This was a huge military success for the Commander in Chief, and our men and women in the military who made this a success. In his announcement, President Trump described Abu as a \u201cdog and a coward.\u201d This drove the Obamaites, and mainstream media into a frenzy as we are used to seeing. The difference for this frenzy and the others is that the left has zero clue why Trump\u2019s words mattered on a global scale.To understand why our President\u2019s speech and carefully chosen words made a difference, you have to dive into who is ISIS, and the facts about their culture. The left has this grand idea of if we just show love and leave the middle east alone, they will do the same in return. This as we all know is a glorious lie that they can\u2019t even hold themselves to doing so with their constant beating of the foreign war drum. ISIS and it\u2019s followers though will not be happy with the words used to describe their leader. This is one thing the left is correct on, however, they are wrong about the rest of the speech. The entire middle east and death culture of Isis thrives on the idea of honor, and glory in death. When our President stood in front of the cameras and told the world that the leader of this disgusting death cult died as a coward, the followers of him begin to question what are they fighting for. I will almost guarantee that with this death blow, you will see more fragments of Isis fall to the side and crumble. These cowards have gripped that region in fear for long enough.Our awesome troops have taken the fight to Isis in the last few years in bold way since President Trump untied their hands to hunt these scumbags down. With these terrorists all being brought to justice, cutting the head off of the snake is a huge notch for the belt of Freedom and Liberty.

The lawsuit, which was filed last month has brought renewed debate as to why the Obama Administration gave Iran the $400 million dollars despite the country being the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terror, and their repeated claims desiring the destruction of Israel and the United States. Judicial Watch filed suit after the State Department and the Treasury Department failed to respond to an August 2016 Freedom of Information Act requesting records pertaining to the transfer of this $400 million dollars to Iran.This large transfer of funds was widely criticized by the Israeli government, Republicans in Washington D.C., and victims of terror financed by Iran. Adding more suspicion to this large cash transfer to Iran was the simultaneous release of five hostages who were being held in an Iranian jail giving the appearance that the $400-million-dollar payment was a ransom.The $400 million dollars paid to Iran stems from an arms deal gone bad back in 1979, when Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Government overthrew the Shah of Iran. At the time Iran\u2019s new government held 52 American hostages from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and in response the American government froze $12 billion dollars in Iranian assets held offshore. When the hostage crisis came to a close in 1981, the U.S. government paid Iran $3 billion dollars and a tribunal was set up between the United States and Iran to hash out further financial disputes. The $400 million comes into play because prior to the Shah of Iran being overthrown, he had paid the United States $400 million dollars as an advanced payment for military hardware. Because of the hostage situation and the U.S. government cutting diplomatic ties with Iran, the $400 million dollars was among the frozen assets, and the Pentagon at the time banned any further delivery of military hardware to Iran. Skip forward to 2016, this was still an issue between the two governments, and the fact that Iran was holding five American hostages, combined with an American President who placates to terrorists, Iran received the $400 million dollars back.", "is_fake": 1},

The so called experts that conducted this study claim these children are racist and/or have biased tendencies because they are only surrounded by their own race. For babies between the age of 6 to 9 months this makes sense since the only people they are around are family. The only exception would be if the baby was in a mixed race family, a variable this study did not examine. From the beginning the intent and hypothesis was flawed The intent was to come up with so pseudo science \u2018proof\u2019 that all white people are racist.Most child development experts have previously agreed that children create racial biased tendencies while they are in preschool, and depending on the environment the child is exposed to this may be true. The Daily Mail reported back in April of this year on the study, \u201cThe findings are said to be a result of the overwhelming exposure infants have to their own race, and experts have warned it iswise to introduce children to people from a variety of races before the issues deepen\u201d. So the experts here purposely exposed children to people of their own race, and were then somehow shocked that the children gravitated toward what they are familiar with? Further, to suggest that parents go out of their way to simply expose their children to others of a different race is preposterous. Especially when you consider that some children may live in a demographic which is predominantly white or black. What these so called experts did not consider is, children will always gravitate to what they know. It has nothing to do with the fact the the child is racist, or they hate someone based on the color of their skin. They are to young to form those judgments. Nevertheless, liberals take this as an opportunity to demonize the white race, and normalize hate against white people in general.The institutions who participated in this study include the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), as well as researchers from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and China. Surprisingly, these geniuses observed \u201cinfants six to nine months of age looked longer at own-race faces when paired with happy music as opposed to with sad music\u201d. This after the babies were subjected to happy and sad music, mixing up the sequence of which race they were shown on a screen when the music was playing. Keep in mind some of these children have been in relatively segregated environments with their parents, and the study and method was not conducted over a very long time frame, nor does it account for the randomness with which kids act.", "is_fake": 1},

The Little Sisters of the Poor had to take the Obama Administration all the way to the Supreme Court, where the court ruled in the Nuns\u2019 favor.While Obama was President, his immigration policy toward Christians was equally discriminatory. As reported by Jim Hoft, from The Gateway Pundit, \u201cObama\u2019s immigration policies showed a distinct bias against Christians. Although 10% of Syrians were Christians and were being murdered by ISIS daily, only 2.4% of immigrants into the US were Christians. At one point in his Presidency, he deported persecuted Chaldean Christians fleeing ISIS\u201d. These Iraqi Christians, a group of 27, crossed into the United States from Mexico.

Last week hundreds if not thousands of highly successful social media pages, with a combined fan base of over a 100 million American citizens and a collective weekly reach of more than a billion views, were deleted from Facebook without any warning or recourse. Facebook says it is \u201cregardless of political slant\u201d however, it is clear from just a quick glance that nearly all of the pages that were removed are right leaning pages.Pages like Occupy Democrats and Media Matters, who are heavy offenders and have been proven to be liars time and time again were left untouched. There is absolutely a political slant. The people who owned and operated these pages and their personal profiles were erased from existence and cut off from family, friends, coworkers and loved ones. They were vilified for generating a family income as \u201cmotivated by money\u201d ironically while Facebook injects paid for \u201csponsored\u201d posts into the news feed displacing those very same people. The reason given for this social media purge was for what Facebook is calling \u201cInauthentic Activity\u201d, \u201cFake News\u201d, \u201cSpam\u201d and \u201cSpreading Misinformation\u201d. These allegations are not true and are merely a veiled attempt to silence views with which management at these companies do not agree.This is nothing short of a modern day digital \u201cNight of the Long Knives\u201d with the expressed intent to exterminate dissenting political views and illegally corrupt and influence the American electoral process just weeks before Americans cast their votes. In the hours following the purge these pages, businesses and grass roots leaders have been systematically vilified as spammers, offensive, bad actors, fake news, hate speech, hyper partisan, clickbait, inauthentic, ad farms and even \u201cRussian bots\u201d by their accomplices in the mainstream media and leftist activist groups. In fact, the Washington Post had an article up within minutes of the pages being removed including accurate figures.

There are a few issues here with having an all-Muslim troop. First, what is the troop\u2019s policy if a Christian, Jew, or Buddhist wants to join? Secondly, why do they need an all-Muslim troop, and why does the corporate office of Boy Scouts of America allow this. There was a time when Boy Scouts were for boys, and Girl Scouts were for girls, and it was similar to joining the U.S. military. Members were expected to wear a uniform, adhere to a certain code of conduct, and in order to earn achievements, one had to perform certain tasks successfully. Now, standards are changed and compromised all in the name of religious accommodation.Like the U.S. military, the Boy Scouts of America is a volunteer organization. The federal government does not mandate that all boys have to join. So, if one is considering joining, and they do not like the uniform standards, rules, or the code of conduct, they have every right not to join. But not in liberal logic, which takes the position that everyone gets a trophy, and we the American people should be expected to change our rules and standards for the peaceful religion of Islam.", "is_fake": 1},

At Liberty High School In Frisco, Texas, the Independent School District decided to convert an entire freaking classroom into a \u201cprayer room\u201d so these Muslims can practice their barbaric religion while at school.Their excuse for favoring Muslim students over Christian students was equally as pathetic, with school officials saying they didn\u2019t want Muslim students to \u201chave to drive home to conduct their daily prayers.\u201d Yes really\u2026.", "is_fake": 1},

Tennessee Titans tight end Delanie Walker has said he has no issue with fans not coming to Titans games or tuning in if they are offended by his disgusting behavior.Last week when the Tennessee Titans played the Seattle Seahawks, the entire team refused to take the field for the national anthem. Speaking of the teams disrespect toward Titans fans and America, Delanie Walker said, \u201cFirst off, I\u2019m going to say this: We\u2019re not disrespecting the military, the men, and women that serve in the Army. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s all about. If you look at most of the guys in here \u2013 I\u2019ve been in the USO. I support the troops. This is not about that. It\u2019s about equal rights, and that\u2019s all everyone is trying to show, is that we all care about each other. And the fans that don\u2019t want to come to the game? I mean, OK. Bye. I mean, if you feel that\u2019s something, we\u2019re disrespecting you, don\u2019t come to the game. You don\u2019t have to. No one\u2019s telling you to come to the game. It\u2019s your freedom of choice to do that.\u201d This is a bold and ignorant statement, to say the least.What Delanie Walker and the rest of his fellow NFL protestors forget is that despite them being at the USO and claiming to support the troops, their actions say otherwise. No one is saying he or his teammates have to change their political views, but when you protest by disrespecting the national anthem with taking a knee, this not only is an offense to the anthem but all the men and women who have served and continue to serve to protect this country. Mr. Walker\u2019s comments are not only disrespectful, but he is apparently ignorant of the financial consequences of his sentiments. If fans don\u2019t come to the games or tune in, his inflated salary goes away. The NFL has already seen an 11% drop in ratings, along with a 17.9% decrease in ticket sales from last week.

This comes as there have been confirmed reports that Hillary Clinton was offered a plea bargain where she would have to agree to plead guilty to violating the law as it pertains to her mishandling of classified information.One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s lawyers has had a series of talks with a prosecutor from the Department of Justice. During these talks, the DOJ prosecutor made it clear that despite former FBI Director James Comey refusing to recommend charges, the case is being reexamined, and the DOJ believes there is more than enough evidence to prosecute Hillary Clinton. The fact that Hillary Clinton was offered a plea deal prior to charges being filed or an arrest made indicates that the DOJ is attempting to put this issue to bed once and for all. This is also a sign that the Department of Justice feels they can get a conviction but want to handle this diplomatically.The plea bargain which Hillary Clinton was offered would require her to sign a document that she violated the law and could be prosecuted for it. In essence, she would be admitting she is a criminal. The DOJ would reciprocate by agreeing not to file charges against Hillary Clinton concerning her emails and mishandling of classified information. Some in Washington D.C. theorize this is President Trump\u2019s way of firing back at the Clinton machine, by putting her in the position of facing prosecution or admitting she is a criminal. Either way, the outcome for Hillary Clinton does not seem to be good. Additionally, the plea bargain offered by the DOJ includes a provision that there would be no further investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s pay to play schemes which involved the Clinton Foundation as well as payments made to Bill Clinton for talks he gave.", "is_fake": 1},

For years, the state legislators have turned a blind eye to illegal immigrants invading California, and many local officials in various counties are more than willing to cooperate. In an effort to stem the tide of illegal immigration into the United States of America, President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have said they will not give grant money to any city that harbors illegal immigrants. In response, the city of Chicago sued the Department of Justice, and a U.S. District judge ruled that Attorney General Jeff Sessions can\u2019t withhold grant money from sanctuary cities. This decision is likely to go before the Supreme Court, and while this decision progresses, the State of California is set to hold a vote on whether or not to become a sanctuary state, and openly defy federal immigration laws.The state of California has been plagued by a series of murders committed by illegal immigrants. These are murders which could have been prevented if the state of California and local officials had followed the law. The murder of Kate Steinle was a high profile case which put the sanctuary city of San Francisco on the map. An illegal immigrant who used a stolen police firearm murdered Kate Steinle. In another incident where an illegal immigrant used a stolen police firearm, illegal immigrant Eric Garcia-Pineda murdered community volunteers Abel Esquive during a robbery attempt. The sad part about both of these cases is they could have easily been prevented, and after they happened, the city of San Francisco has remained steadfast in their defiance of President Trump and federal immigration law. In the case of Eric Garcia-Pineda, federal agents were monitoring his whereabouts and at one point had him in custody, but because he was let go by a federal judge who required him to wear an electronic monitoring device and check in, he was free to commit murder. Not surprisingly Mr. Garcia-Pineda removed his electronic tracking device and never showed up for his check in appointments.In spite of all the carnage caused by illegal immigrants in the state of California, state legislators have now passed \u201cSanctuary State\u201d legislation. The legislation directs local police departments not to cooperate with federal authorities, and increases protections for illegal immigrants. In essence, it is illegal legislation condoning the violation of federal immigration law and puts California residents in increased danger. This \u201cSanctuary State\u201d legislation also dictates that local police are not allowed to ask someone about their immigration status when they are arrested.", "is_fake": 1},

When a human goes into space and experiences a lack of gravity working on the body, effects such as bone loss, fatigue, and a weakened immune system are just some of the things that can happen. With scientists studying the regenerative powers of worms, this knowledge may possibly be used to reverse or minimize the risks to astronauts in space. Additionally, this research may also benefit humans on earth as it relates to treating various forms of disease and infection.The worms were sent into space to the International Space Station for five weeks where the worms were stored in containers with spring water and air.

In addition, he has also directed the State Department to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Naturally, liberals and radical Muslims collectively lost their minds, calling the decision \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to creating the two-state solution. After announcing his decision, President Trump uploaded a video to his Twitter account, which is a compilation of past American Presidents promising to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama all promised to officially recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and they all failed. President Bush even promised to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and never did so.Though President Trump and the nation of Israel are committed to the peace process, it is clear that the Palestinian Authority is against any sort of peace, and despite what is on paper, the Palestinians will never recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. Speaking on what part of Jerusalem would be Israel\u2019s capital, President Trump said, \u201cWe are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved.\u201d However, this explanation did not satisfy those against the President\u2019s decision with British Prime Minister Theresa May calling President Trump\u2019s decision on Jerusalem, \u201cUnhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.\u201d What Prime Minister Theresa May and others fail to understand is that the Palestinians do not want peace. The main objective of the Palestinians is to kill Jews and wipe Israel off of the map. Critics of President Trump would be wise to read between the lines and see this, as the Palestinians through the course of history have had ample opportunity to have their own state, but have refused various peace deals because some part of Jerusalem would consist of an Israeli capital. Not surprisingly, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor all condemned President Trump. Interesting considering all of these leaders has allowed their countries to become infested with radical Islamic terrorists.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that by President Trump officially declaring Jerusalem Israel\u2019s capital that the United States has now given up their position as a mediator in the peace process. The head of the Palestinian negotiating team, Saeb Erekat said, \u201cPresident Trump just destroyed any policy of a two-state solution.\u201d Both President Abbas and Mr. Erekat would be wise to look at their own history and realize the Palestinians could have had their own state years ago.

As proof of this Palestinians like Hamdi Dyab \u201cThis is very dangerous speech. Things don\u2019t look good.

But what cow eats these grains naturally \u2013 none. Cows are supposed to graze on grass in a wide-open field. So when cows are given a grass-fed diet, the milk and meat they produce is much healthier and more natural. It\u2019s just common sense.Cows that are fed soy and corn produce fats that are not good for your body. Why? Because they don\u2019t fully digest the corn and soy.
