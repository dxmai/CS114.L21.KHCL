One example is the earthquake in Fukushima in 2011. The science is backed up by a report from MIT. Wigington explains, \u201cAll this data is extremely verifiable.  Their words were \u2018extremely anomalous heating directly above the epicenter in the days prior to the quake.\u2019 . . . The Fukashima meltdown was not intended, but when you trigger seismic activity on that scale, massive consequences happen. . . . The ability to cause seismic activity with radio frequency microwave transmissions is very well documented scientifically. . . . There is no official source that is willing to discuss this because it is simply too alarming to the population. The liability issues from decimating food supplies and tripping seismic activity is incomprehensible.

That threatens all the heavily indebted people out there because as rates go up, their costs rise. Then they go bankrupt in increasing numbers, and the system collapses.

I have been warning about the consequences of all this money printing for years and years. Now, finally, you are really starting to see that.

It finished at a little more than $1,900 per ounce. Hemke was spot on. So, what is Hemke predicting this year? Hemke says, \u201cIn my annual forecast that I just published last week, one of my themes was \u2018don\u2019t fight the Fed.\u2019 If you have been a stock market investor, I am sure you have heard that term used before, and it works for the precious metals this year as well. The Fed will take some significant actions over the course of this year, and that will drive gold and silver higher. Gold will go to new all-time highs at some point, and silver is going to participate too.\u201dHemke contends the Fed will be obsessed with rising interest rates and printing enormous amounts of money to suppress them. Hemke explains, \u201cAt the end of 2018, the Fed had been on this course for five years and spinning this lie that they were going to normalize their balance sheet. This meant they were going to go back down to $1 trillion, which is where they were in 2008. (Currently the Fed balance sheet/debt is more than $7 trillion and rising.) . . . . It was never going to happen\u2014never. They also said they were going to normalize interest rates. So, retirees who wanted to live off of CD\u2019s and interest rates going back to 7%. That was never going to happen either. We have so much accumulated debt, not just public, but private, that the economy will absolutely collapse . . . if interest rates go up. . . . The U.S. economy cannot afford higher rates. Whether it\u2019s line item interest on the national debt because that could exponentially could go out of control or the private debt where people who just barely have a $1,000 in savings can\u2019t have their credit card rates go over 20%, or auto rates go back over 6% or 7%, or mortgage rates go to 4% or 5%. They just can\u2019t. When we talk about rates going higher, it\u2019s not that the 10 Year Treasury goes to 1.15%, which is where it is now, what they can\u2019t afford is the 10 Year Treasury going to 2% or 3%. . . . As inflation picks up from all this money printing, the Fed can\u2019t allow the 10 Year Treasury to go to 3% . . . the Fed will, at some point, institute yield curve control.\u201dHemke says yield curve control by the Fed will cap interest rates, but the money printing and inflation will have to rise dramatically.

This year, EvG\u2019s company, Matterhorn Asset Management, has seen \u201ca major inflow, a massive inflow of big amounts of gold\u201d being vaulted by his wealthy clients. Why the big spike in people wanting physical gold? EvG says, \u201cYou have seen this year incredible money creation around the world by central banks along with the massive debt increases. You are looking at . . . the money supply, which has been going up for 50 years, but now . . . it\u2019s going up in a straight line. So, we are now entering into the exponential phase of this financial system. We are seeing unlimited money printing, helicopter money like Ben Bernanke (former Fed Head) called it. Then we are going to see accelerated debasement of the currency. The real moves in gold and silver haven\u2019t started yet.\u201dThis next move, according to EvG, is going to be a global phenomenon. EvG explains, \u201cThe bond market is going to collapse, and interest rates are going to go a lot higher.

When the currency falls, we will see hyperinflation. . . . The next group of people that are going to come into this are the institutional investors. We\u2019ve already seen signs of that. . . . The risk I would say is the highest ever in history. You have never had a situation in history where basically every country in the world is in the same position.

Gold should be $20,000 per ounce on an inflation adjusted basis. . . . When gold is $100,000 or $100 million (per ounce) or whatever it reaches, then everyone is going to be talking about gold.

Now, we are seeing massive money printing to bail out everything and everyone. How does Dr. Roberts, who holds a PhD in economics, see this? Dr. Roberts says, \u201cThe problem is there is already more debt than can be serviced. That\u2019s why they are trying to bail it out by issuing more debt. It\u2019s like kicking the can down the road until it blows up. When does it blow up? It didn\u2019t blow up with a $4.5 trillion Federal Reserve balance sheet. Will it blow up at $10 trillion or does it have to be $15 trillion, or does the Fed\u2019s balance sheet have to be the size of the US GDP before it blows up? I can\u2019t say that I know, but I do know bailing out debt by creating more debt is not a solution.\u201dWhat is the solution? Dr. Roberts says, \u201cWe need a debt jubilee. Debt jubilees were widely used in the ancient world. The way economies tend to work is through time, debts expand. People get more and more indebted, and before long, they don\u2019t have any discretionary income, and they can\u2019t buy any increase in output and they can\u2019t service their debts. Either the system goes into collapse, or you write the debts down and you start over. So, that\u2019s what I think. I think . . . we need a debt jubilee, and debts need to be written down.

They are not fixing the problem by creating more debt to bail out existing debt. That doesn\u2019t fix the problem. You\u2019ve got to get rid of debt. It\u2019s not the federal debt that we need to worry about. They can print all the money they want to redeem US Treasury bonds.

Are people going to say, good heavens, do we really want to hold dollars when they are creating so many? People are saying we don\u2019t know how this is going to play out, but they can\u2019t print gold, so let\u2019s get into gold. . . . I don\u2019t know how people are going to see this, but the enormous money creation, no doubt, worries some . . . .

What is the ability of the U.S. military versus the Russian or Chinese military to defend the dollar\u2019s position? That is intelligence that Putin has, and because Putin has this intelligence, people really stood up and I really stood up and took notice. If Putin has access to that intelligence, and I don\u2019t, which is saying the dollar could go into a deep decline, we need to take a serious look at it. The dollar is clearly under pressure, and if you look at reserves, the central banks are buying gold and selling dollars, including the Russians and Chinese.\u201dFitts also points out, \u201cThe dollar is holding, and yet, if you look at the price of household goods in America, where I live, it\u2019s approximately 8% to 10% a year in prices of household goods (going up), and you can tell the money printing has been significant.

One of the scenarios I am looking at is the dollar declines significantly in 2020. . . . When you have real household inflation at 10% every year for the past five years, the dollar has really already taken a hit as are many fiat currencies around the world. . . . What has really supported the dollar is its huge market share both in trade and traditionally in reserves. . . . You need to withstand a scenario where in 2020, instead of getting 10% inflation, you need to withstand 20% or 25% inflation in real household goods. . . .

If you look at the integrity behind the dollar, it\u2019s not there.

Kunstler explains, \u201cWhat I am waiting for is if and when indictments come down from Mr. Barr and Mr. Durham. I am wondering whether the editors and publishers of the Washington Post and New York Times and the producers at CNN and MSNBC are going to be named as unindicted co-conspirators in this effort to gaslight the country and really stage a coup to remove the President and to nullify the 2016 election. I say this as someone who is not necessarily a Trump supporter. I didn\u2019t vote for the guy. I am not a cheerleader for the guy, but basically, I think the behavior of his antagonists has been much worse and much more dangerous for the nation and the American project as a long term matter. I really need to see some action to hold people responsible for the acts they have committed. . . . I am not an attorney, and I have never worked for the Department of Justice, but it seems to me that by naming the publishers and editors of these companies as unindicted co-conspirators, that allows you to avoid the appearance of trying to shut down the press because you are not going to put them in jail, but you are going to put them in disrepute. That may prompt their boards of directors to fire a few people and maybe change the way they do business at these places.\u201dKunstler says things look unlike anything we have seen in the past because we are approaching a day of reckoning in our debt based monetary system. Kunstler says, \u201cYeah, I think you can see it happening now. What seems to be resolving is some movement to some sort of a crackup of the banking system. What we are really stuck in is a situation where we\u2019ve got too many obligations we cannot meet and too many debts that will never be repaid. We have been trying to run the country for the past 15 or 20 years on debt because we can no longer provide the kind of industrial growth that we have been used to . . . and have this massive consumer spending industry. So, we have been borrowing from the future to pay our bills today, and we are running out of our ability to borrow more. . . . I think we are going to lose the ability to support a lot of activities that we have been doing. It starts with energy and its relationship to banking and our ability to generate the kind of growth you need to keep rolling over debt. The reason debt will never be paid and obligations will never be met is we are not generating that sort of growth. We\u2019re just generating frauds and swindles. Frauds and swindles are fun while you are doing them, and they seem to produce a lot of paper profits, but after a while, they prove to be false. Then you have to do something else.

If you show this chart to a child and ask where is that likely to go, it is likely to go to zero. DB, with their $50 trillion in derivatives, there is no chance they will survive. Of course, Germany and the ECB is panicking because that will affect the whole banking system worldwide.

That\u2019s when I started thinking about the rest of the world or the rest of the story. The rest of the story goes something like this: Venezuela used to sell all of its oil in dollars. Russia used to sell all of its oil in dollars. Iran used to sell all of its oil in dollars. Iraq used to sell all of its oil in dollars, and up until very recently, Saudi Arabia used to sell all of its crude oil in dollars, but I believe they are now selling some of their oil in currency other than dollars. So, we have many millions of barrels of oil that were formerly transacted in dollars, and these barrels of oil are now being priced in other currencies. The dollars that used to buy that oil are now looking for a home, and they didn\u2019t have a home. So, America had to create a home for those dollars, which is why America has ramped up their crude oil production. In the 2004 time period, America\u2019s oil production bottomed out at 4 million barrels a day, and now it is producing 12 1/2 million barrels a day making it the world\u2019s largest producer of crude oil.

Williams contends, \u201cThe Fed was working against him (President Trump) on the economy, and they still are. Their primary concern is the banking system, and that certainly has to be supported, but when you have a weak economy, and this was fueled by the tightening of the Fed, I don\u2019t think Trump is going to get blamed for that. It\u2019s going to go against the Fed, and I don\u2019t think it is going to hurt him that much in the upcoming election. Williams says the real numbers say the economy is getting worse and not better. Williams thinks \u201cThe Fed is going to feel pressure to cut interest rates .5%\u201d and not .25% that Fed Head Jay Powell has been indicating. Williams also thinks the Fed is going to feel pressure to start a \u201cnew round of QE.\u201d Why? Williams says, \u201cFirst of all, the economy is that weak. I am seeing it in the numbers, and I am sure they (Fed) are too. . . . The headline numbers that you hear are bloated, and they know it. . . . Construction spending is a lot weaker than reported. . . . So, we know the GDP is overstated. . . . They just reduced payroll employment . . . They overestimated payroll growth by 501,000. This eliminates 20% of the employment growth you have seen in the last year. . . . This also will be reflected in the GDP, and it will continue to get weaker. The Fed should be recognizing they have some bad numbers here. I think you are going to see retail sales numbers weaken. They will be out later this week, and also industrial manufacturing numbers will be weaker. They will be out next week. This is all before the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting. The economy is weak enough that they\u2019ve got to do something that will stimulate the economy by cutting more than a quarter point. There is a fair shot they go a half point (cut) and if not, they will be easing again soon. As things turn more negative, they are going to have to turn back to quantitative easing (money printing).\u201dContrary to mainstream media propaganda, the tanking economy is clearly the Fed\u2019s fault. Williams points out, \u201cWhen the Fed started tightening quarter after quarter, which started in 2017, and at that point, the interest rate was 1.5% for targeted Fed Funds. When we finished 2018 in December, they were up to 2.5%. The underlying interest rate there had been doubled in a year. That\u2019s not gradual and non-disruptive to the economy.

The smartest thing the Fed can do right now at the next Fed meeting (June 18 & 19) is to cut the Fed Funds Rate by 50 basis points. They could at least kind of get the yield curve flat again, and not leave it so it looks like you are definitely headed into a recession. (Fed Head) Powell is not going to do that because it will look like he\u2019s doing what Trump is telling him to do. . . .He\u2019s probably going to cut by a quarter point. . . .

Is the recent jump in gold prices confirming this? Sinclair says yes and predicts a two-tier reset in the next few years. . . . The first will be a devaluing of the dollar. Sinclair explains, \u201cThe reset has already started. . . . The only thing holding up the dollar is its universal use as a contract settlement mechanism in Russia and China and everywhere else, and that simply is not happening anymore. . . . The dollar is going lower. . . . In the first reset, the dollar will get sliced in half. That means the little guy will get sliced in half in terms of his buying power. You need to look at gold, not a speculation, but as a savings account. If the dollar gets sliced in half, you basically double the value (of your gold) if not more. I think much more. . . . In the second reset, that will take gold to a price where it will balance the ability to pay global debt. That\u2019s the major move coming forward. Right now, we are definitely going back to the $1,850 and $1,925 area per ounce for gold. The second reset, you can pick any price you want for gold. Pick a high price.\u201dWith the national debt officially at $22 trillion, and the additional \u201cmissing\u201d $21 trillion discovered by Economics Professor Mark Skidmore at Michigan State University in 2017, you have a huge amount of debt and dollars floating around. This fact makes Sinclair\u2019s prediction of $50,000 per ounce gold a few years ago look conservative. Bill Holter has done the math and says it simply must go much higher. Holter explains, \u201cIf you take the 8,300 tons the U.S. supposedly has, and I did this math last year when the official national debt was approaching $21 trillion, gold would need to be $87,000 per ounce to cover just the on books debt. I am not talking about the \u201cmissing\u201d money, not future guarantees, pensions, Social Security and things like that. . . . So, the number is $87,000 per ounce for gold or multiples of that. What\u2019s going to happen? The people who are running this understand this as much as we do, and the system is going to go down. So, why not create a false flag and kick the table over so you can point at it and say our policies would have worked if it wasn\u2019t for whatever event they come up with.\u201d", "is_fake": 1},

Stockman contends, \u201cThe Fed drove up costs, prices and wages at 2% come hell or high water. You do that for two or three decades and, all of a sudden, you are totally uncompetitive. You have the highest cost structure in the world economy, and the jobs and production migrate to where companies can find lower costs and better profits. So, the Fed hit the economy and the middle-class, what I call fly-over America, with a double whammy. The Fed\u2019s 2% inflation drove jobs offshore and undermined wages and the middle-class economy. At the same time, it vastly inflated and subsidized a massive gambling spree and financial asset inflation on Wall Street. . . . Not only was this (Fed) policy the enemy of MAGA . . . it also created a dangerous distortion in the distribution of national wealth.\u201dStockman points out that debt is the highest ever in almost every sector of the economy, and much of it is never getting paid back. Is there a big global default coming? Stockman says, \u201cYes, it is very likely, and this is why it is so dangerous to be in the stock market today because the whole thing is propped up by debt. As soon as the defaults begin to cascade through the system, there is going to be a tremendous correction. At the same time this debt was exploding from $40 trillion to $250 trillion (globally), the balance sheet of the central banks went from $2 trillion to $25 trillion. . . . The central banks of the world have taken their balance sheets from $2 trillion to $25 trillion in roughly two decades, and all of that is one giant fraud because to buy all those assets . . . they just made it up. It was fiat credit. They issued credit . . . made out of thin air. So, what we have in the world economy underpinning this $250 trillion of debt is a massively bloated and fraudulent central banking system and balance sheet that made all this possible.\u201dStockman goes on to say, \u201cThe key point is that it is all coming to an end. . . . Central banks are beginning to shrink their balance sheet for the first time in the last 20 years and not just a little bit. . . . In the inverse, the opposite effect is going to happen.

The reality is if you don\u2019t address it on the front side, it\u2019s virtually meaningless to address it afterwards. Trump\u2019s talking about it and people reading my book and watching shows like this means they are paying attention. There is a story in Texas that happened not too long ago where it was confirmed that members of the Texas Democrat Party were sending voter registration forms with the boxes already marked that said, \u2018Yes, I am a citizen; Yes, I would like to register to vote,\u2019 and they were sending them to noncitizens and sending them to dead people. So, that is serving voter fraud up on a platter. The Texas Democrat party behind it is only confirmation of what many have known for a long time and what I write about in the book. There is an organized effort to exploit the vulnerabilities in our election system, and, thankfully, people are taking it seriously.\u201dIn short, the Democrats have no message and are trying to win by cheating because that is all they have. Eggers says no message means the tactics are turning vile and desperate for Democrats. Eggers explains, \u201cThink about the things we have seen that have occurred nationally. We have seen this caravan of people that are coming through Mexico. So, any effort to try to block that will be seen as anti-humanitarian.

That\u2019s for a city, not a state or a country, and if you add their unfunded liabilities for their pensions, which is another $50 billion or so, and their official debt, which is $50 billion or so, you get $200 billion that New York City is on the hook for that they have not put money away for. If a private sector company had finances like that, they would be insolvent, and their accountants would force them to say that.\u201dYou can tell the same story for cities, states and countries around the world swimming in unrepayable debt. So, what will be done when bond defaults and financial failures begin? Will Trump let it go like the failed debt of Puerto Rico or have massive bailouts? Rubino says, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that Trump will teach that lesson to the system, but I think the numbers are so big now the risk of a 1930\u2019s style depression, or a Weimar Germany hyperinflation, is so great these guys are going to be terrified of anything that seems to be destabilizing. The pressure on whoever is in charge of the central bank or federal government is going to be to try to nip crises in the bud before they can really get going when you don\u2019t know what is going to happen. For instance, New York City goes bankrupt, and that pulls down Chicago, and then that pulls down California. What does that mean?

The question is who is buying it? The only credible answer is the debt is being monetized. This $21 trillion . . . in \u201cmissing money\u201d . . . is being mobilized to monetize the debt.

How long can the heavily indebted and manipulated global economy go before it blows or can it go on indefinitely? Holter says, \u201cIt can\u2019t keep going because it\u2019s already stopped. The inflection point has already been hit. If you look at credit growth, it\u2019s not credit growth. It\u2019s either credit stagnation or credit contraction. The global financial system is a Ponzi scheme. In order to continue to reflate it, you have to have . . . exponentially more debt. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve been, and now we are at the point of debt saturation. There is really no ability to add more debt. Look at the U.S. for example. The U.S. pays $300 billion to $400 billion a year going all the way back to the 1990\u2019s. That number never went higher, even though the amount of debt doubled and then doubled again. The reason it didn\u2019t go higher is they pushed interest rates from 7% down to basically zero percent. So, the debt service amount never grew, and now it\u2019s growing, and it\u2019s growing at a time when the U.S. has basically already crossed the banana republic threshold of 100% debt to GDP.

Holter says, \u201cGold and silver have no liability. They have no liability whatsoever. They are pure monetary assets. There is no currency anywhere in the world that is backed directly by anything except the full faith and credit of the central banks. That\u2019s the key. The world is awash in credit and awash in liabilities, and as this thing bursts, and it\u2019s bursting right now right before your very eyes, and you are seeing it in the stock markets and bigger in the credit markets, when this thing bursts, people are going to scramble to get out from under liability. There\u2019s only one way to do that . . . when credit begins to evaporate, then the cover over gold and silver is going to be lifted.\u201dThere is going to be a reset of this unpayable debt, and Holter says, \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen, and I hope for not a very long period of time. I am hoping it\u2019s just a two week or four week event where the system goes down and goes back up. If I am wrong, then you are looking at a Mad Max world. . . . Basically, nothing works. Your electricity doesn\u2019t work. Your car may or may not work. We may have an EMP or it will work until you run out of gas. When credit breaks down, then distribution breaks down.

Just last week, a billion dollars of gold (paper contracts) was reportedly dumped on the market in about a minute. The price went down less than $10 per ounce and, shortly afterwards, bounced back up. Morgan explains, \u201cThey are running out of ammunition as far as I can tell, which means when they do these massive sell-offs, they are being less and less effective. They have to use more and more power to get less and less result. This is why I am saying they are running out of ammunition. They have to do a fair amount of work to get the price down, and then it bounces right back. It shows you the resilience in the gold market. They can\u2019t push it down, but they are not going to let it rise either because of this pricing mechanism to say dollar good, gold bad.\u201dMorgan says the silver price in the $14 per ounce range and gold around $1,200 per ounce is about mining cost for both metals. Morgan says, \u201cThis tells me you can\u2019t get it much lower for very long. . . . Central banks are buying gold not because it is in the monetary system, but because of fear\u2013fear of what is going to happen to the U.S. dollar. That is a fundamental fact. Where are we technically? I\u2019d say we are near a bottom right now (in both metals). Gold is now making a higher low, and silver is also making a higher low. . . . I think by the end of the year that we will be certain that this is the low.\u201dThere is another very big reason to own physical gold and silver, and that is the possibility the Deep State and the Globalists will crash the financial markets. This is not a farfetched concept as President Trump has declared a \u201cnational emergency\u201d to \u201cprotect the financial system\u201d in a December 2017 Executive Order. Morgan thinks, \u201cIf you look at the potential reaction by the Deep State, these people do not lose gracefully. . . . These people will stop at absolutely nothing.

Celente says, \u201cWe believe we are setting up now for a market crash that will be the worst in modern American history. The fundamentals are . . . the loan bubble. There is $250 trillion worth of debt out there. Let\u2019s put this together. What did the Federal Reserve do last week? They raised interest rates. Now, we are looking at the Fed Funds Rate back to 2008 levels. What\u2019s going on in the emerging markets? As those interest rates go up in the states, you are seeing currencies crashing. They are hitting new lows in Argentina, Turkey and India. At the same time . . . oil is back up at 2014 levels. . . . Go back to the last five recessions. What were they preceded by? Higher oil prices. When the higher oil prices kick in, the recession kicks in, and the markets go down and gold prices go up. . . . We do not give financial advice, but gold right now, we believe, is at the bottom. You might get a price $30 per ounce lower, but the risk is very low . . . because $1,200 per ounce is around mining cost.\u201dSo, what is the timeline for this coming market meltdown? Celente says, \u201cThe timeline is tough, but look . . . all you need is one major failure or one major hedge fund pulling out because that\u2019s who is running the show. You look at the number of stocks that have declined . . . . Look at the big hedge funds and the private equity groups that are running this, and look at their debt level. It does not take a genius to figure this out. If you have $250 trillion worth of (global) debt and interest rates are going up, and it\u2019s costing you more to borrow as you are making less, what is going to happen? It\u2019s going to collapse. . . . You\u2019ve got to pay more on your debt, and your debt is ballooning. Of course, it\u2019s going to crash.

Schiff says, \u201cI was kind of a fixture on financial cable TV giving these warnings. My thought was the bubble would burst, and I knew that it would. Once the housing bubble burst and we had this financial crisis, I knew it would follow along with the Great Recession. I thought the Federal Reserve would try the best it could to reflate the bubbles in the stock markets and housing markets. But my thought was that their efforts would fail. The markets would not allow it and that a dollar collapse would intervene and would prevent new debt from being issued to fully reflate those bubbles. I was actually wrong. They didn\u2019t just try to reflate the bubbles, they actually succeeded in blowing them bigger than ever.\u201dTen years later, Schiff is warning of another financial calamity bigger than the last one. Schiff says, \u201cThe problem is now we are on the precipice of a much bigger crisis than before. The next time, if they try to reflate those bubbles, which they will, it will be a spectacular failure because the markets are now prepared for the opposite. Everybody, right now, assumes the Fed is going to be able to keep raising rates. They assume they are going to shrink its balance sheet and that we have this booming economy that will never bust. When the Fed has to reverse course abruptly, acknowledge the underlying weakness that everybody has been oblivious to and they start cutting rates and launching another round of quantitative easing (money printing), I think the dollar is going to fall through the floor. I think the inflationary fires that are already burning pretty hot are going to ignite. It\u2019s not going to be like 2008 where the dollar went up and consumer prices inched down a little bit. I think the dollar is going to tank and consumer prices are going to soar, and it\u2019s going to be stagflation. When the markets get a whiff of that, they are not going to like the way it smells. It is going to create a dollar crisis. I think the Fed has put itself between a rock and a hard place. There is no way out this time. . . . This time, you really have to be positioned because this time is going to be the end of it. This is not going to be a hat trick or third time is a charm when it comes to reflating these bubbles.\u201dOn gold, Schiff contends, \u201cPeople are going to be dumping their dollars and buying gold. . . . If you understood what the Fed was doing, you would be buying gold, but most people don\u2019t understand. You can look at what has happened to gold prices in terms of other currencies, such as emerging markets. Obviously, gold prices in those countries measured in those currencies have gone up dramatically. So, gold has acted as a store of value and a store of purchasing power in every country where the currency has come down. The same thing is going to hold true of the United States. . . . We could do a reset. We could go back to sound money. We could go back on a gold standard, and we could devalue the dollar officially. I don\u2019t know exactly how high the price of gold would have to be, $10,000 per ounce, $20,000 per ounce, who knows, but there is a price where we could go back to a gold standard. If we want to stay on a gold standard, that means the government would have to live within its means.

Whether we have three more years of growth or a recession next year, we are going to see massive new deficits and massive increases in government debt all over the world. This is coming at a time when we have already hit record levels of debt and blown right through previous record levels. The last crisis, that almost ended the global financial system, was debt driven.

The emerging market countries (including Turkey) have screwed up their money. They borrowed a lot of U.S. dollars at low interest rates when the dollar was falling. They expected the dollar to keep falling and pay back their loans in ever cheaper dollars, but the dollar went the other way. So, now their loans are unpayable. Their currencies are blowing up, and you are seeing gold and silver rise in local currency terms. In other words, precious metals are protecting the citizens of those countries against financial mismanagement.\u201dRubino warns, \u201cThe crisis eventually works its way all the way to the middle, which is what happened after the housing bubble burst in 2007. It was just sub-prime mortgagees to begin with, which was not really a big deal, but eventually it became a near death experience for the entire global banking system. Since that time, instead of getting our financial houses in order around the world, we basically kept on borrowing money. Now, we have almost twice as much debt globally as we had in that debt driven global financial crisis. So, you can expect the next one . . . to be bigger, scarier and more dangerous. There are a lot of reasons to believe we are getting close, and one of those reasons is the emerging markets are starting to blow up.\u201dRubino also points out, \u201cThe \u201cCrack-Up Boom\u201d is the point at which everybody figures out it is the explicit policy of their government to make their currency worth less year after year after year, and they don\u2019t want to hold the currency anymore. So, as soon as they get paid, they turn that money into real stuff. You see the price of real things spike because everybody is buying real stuff at whatever price they have to pay. That manifests as accelerating inflation, but it is really a loss of faith in the currency. I think that is the end game of this system. The central banks are bailing out so many different players with so much new currency that people figure out that is a bad deal for the holders of that currency. They start front-running the process, and the system breaks down. This could be the time that it happens because the amount of debt that would have to be bailed out by the central banks is immense.

You don\u2019t kowtow to political pressure when you need to do right by the economy. . . . Powell thinks the inflation numbers are under-reported.

The greatest peril of debt is we don\u2019t know where the danger truly lies until something triggers it.\u201dWhere could the next debt problem be? DiMartino Booth says, \u201cThere are trillions and trillions of dollars of leverage in this country that are not regulated by any entity and could cause problems in and of themselves. Can I rattle your memory with Angelo Mozilo and Countrywide? Again, a big company that was not regulated, and look at these problems, these subprime unregulated lenders caused way back when.

In the last few years, the commitment by the American government, the European government and the Asian governments have become much more overt.

The biggest buyers of U.S. Treasuries are U.S. pensions. Basically, the U.S. pensions are buying trillions of dollars of U.S. Treasuries, and the money goes into the government, and then the money goes out the back door. In the meantime, the taxpayers, including those pension beneficiaries, are on the hook for those Treasuries. So, you are giving away real money, and all you are getting is a liability. . . .So, the federal government literally becomes a laundry mechanism. . . . Now, I am seeing multiple efforts, disinformation efforts, fear porn and hope porn all pushing that it would be a good idea to dissolve the U.S. government and auction off the assets, which is the \u201crape of Russia\u201d plan right here in America.

With all the heave selling, the bond yields were rising and investors didn\u2019t like that. Risings bond yields means someone is selling bonds. The Fed was not selling bonds, they were not rolling over the bonds they normally wood. . . . There was a big drop in the amount of bonds the Fed was holding in the last week by about $10 billion. That was the biggest weekly decline since August of 2012. . . . It was enough to put some upside pressure on the interest rates . . . and that was a trigger (for the stock market sell-off). Normally, you don\u2019t crash from an all-time high, not that it crashed, but you did have pretty heavy selling. You didn\u2019t see much movement in the dollar. You didn\u2019t see much movement in gold, and when this market really goes, I think you are going to see the dollar selling off very rapidly and gold being a flight to safe haven.\u201dWilliams goes on to say, \u201cThe Fed caused this latest round of selling because they are reducing their balance sheet. I would say the Fed is in a real awkward position here because the economy is not doing what they are advertising, at least what you are seeing in the headline data. I think you are going to see a rapid slowdown in the next couple of months. Then you are going to see the markets say what\u2019s the Fed doing here? The Fed will have to go back to quantitative easing (QE or money printing). When you see that again, that should be a heavy sell signal for the dollar. It will be a flight from the dollar that will spike oil prices and give us an inflation problem. This will tend to spike gold prices. As foreign investors flee from the dollar, they will also be fleeing from the stock market and the U.S. bond market. You will see stock selling and bond selling and then higher yields, and the Fed will be coming in and start buying the bonds again. I think that is where we are heading.\u201dSo, are the Trump tax cuts going to help the economy or hurt it? The answer is both. Williams explains, \u201cThe tax cuts are generally positive. Anytime you cut taxes, that is generally a plus for the economy. The problem is the average guy is still not making ends meet. Anything that increases disposable income is a plus. This does not necessarily go to the guys at the lower end of the income scale, but generally there should be a little economic pick up here from it. The problem is what happens to the budget deficit. We just went through the government shutdown and a package that lays things out for the next two years, but it widens the deficit. The deficit is beyond control. We have $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. That means you need $100 trillion in hand right now to cover the federal obligations going forward. . . . Printing money to meet obligations is what happened in the Weimar Republic in Germany. This happened in Zimbabwe. This kind of thing eventually gives you a hyperinflation. . . . Ongoing budget deficit and debasing of the dollar will give you global selling pressures in the currency markets. . . . We haven\u2019t seen much selling in the dollar, but that is going to change.

Is he nervous? Smith says, \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s definitely destabilizing. In other words, it\u2019s becoming not just more volatile, the whole underlying structure of our economy is destabilizing. What I mean by that is it\u2019s becoming more brittle or fragile. That is fundamentally why we are seeing these wild swings. People are swinging between . . . keeping the money machine like it is for another nine years, and the other side of the coin says wait a minute, we have already had a weak expansion for nine years. It\u2019s almost the longest expansion in U.S. history. A normal business cycle doesn\u2019t run in one direction forever. . . .If you don\u2019t allow your economy to have a business cycle recession, then you are simply making it more fragile by encouraging really marginal and risky investments, and that\u2019s where we are now.\u201dOne very big problem is a dramatic loss in buying power of the U.S. dollar, but it\u2019s not just the dollar. According to Smith, \u201cAll these currencies, there is nothing backing the currencies except the government\u2019s force. That\u2019s the yen, the euro, the dollar and the Chinese yuan. They are all going to have a catastrophic drop against real assets because they are all based on too much leverage, too much debt, too much money being pumped into the financial system that ends up in unproductive speculation. You can\u2019t grow your debt at six times the rate of your economy. In other words, if you are creating $6, $8 or $10 of debt to eke out $1 of low productivity growth, you are dooming your currency, and all currencies are doing the same thing. All the currencies are going to take a big drop at some point . . . relative to real stuff. Real stuff is commodities we need: water, grains, food, oil, natural gas and, of course, precious metals.

Now, as you mentioned, we had forecast a 10% correction. Here\u2019s our forecast now. We believe the Trump rally is near its peak. It may go up more, and here is why it will. Trump is allowing companies to bring back money from overseas.

George Bush did that back in 2003 and 2004. Do you know where the money went? 96% went into stock buybacks, not capital improvements.

Take every company that has a market cap of $2 billion or higher and a price to earnings (P/E) of more than 50 or higher and what do you get? You get a list of 236 companies. These are not small companies . . . these are big companies. We saw a number of these things that showed up in 2000, but they were really concentrated in the tech sector. This time . . . you\u2019ve got bio tech, food companies, Yelp, 21 companies from the oil and gas sector. These are all sorts of different sectors, and what we are seeing is caution to the wind and fundamentals don\u2019t matter. That means if you buy a company with a 50 P/E, you are willing to wait 50 years at current earnings to earn that dollar back. I also found page after page of companies with 200, 300 and 400 P/E. It\u2019s astonishing.\u201dMartenson points out that things like stocks and bonds are not wealth, but claims on wealth. Martenson says the paper side of the equation has \u201cbeen growing twice as fast as the real stuff.\u201d Martenson goes on to say, \u201cSo, there always has to be a relationship to the claims we are making and the amount of real stuff. For now, let\u2019s call the real stuff the GDP of nations of the world. When you see the claims and GDP get really out of alignment, that\u2019s historically always resulted in the claims going poof. That\u2019s happened lots of times in history.\u201dMartenson contends markets were not allowed to take their natural course in the 2008 financial meltdown. Martenson says, \u201cIn 2008, it broke. It wasn\u2019t just a housing bubble that broke. That doesn\u2019t explain why Greece went down. Greece didn\u2019t have exposure to the U.S. housing market. Something else broke, and it was too much debt. . . . The Fed said we will fix that by adding more debt. That was a crazy idea. In 2008, it was like we fell off a 6 foot ladder. It was kind of painful. We should have allowed big institutions that made bad decisions to go bust, to allow the debt to burn itself out of the system. We would be already rebuilding in a way younger generations could believe in. Instead, the Federal Reserve tried to deny that reality . . . and triple down, and I fear now we are 22 rungs up an extension ladder. This next fall is going to be really scary. I am very worried when that next fall comes, we are going to see the destruction of quite a few things that are going to be worrisome. . . . It will blow at some point. . . . When this next downturn comes, it will be very, very rapid because we don\u2019t have people in the markets anymore. It\u2019s all computers. It will be very quick and very sudden and impossible for all those people to get out.\u201d", "is_fake": 1},

It will definitely affect capital flows. There is a debate about arresting people and perp walks, whether that would be good or bad for confidence. It\u2019s my opinion it would initially be bad for confidence because there are so many people (that would be criminally charged) it would blow their minds. It\u2019s beyond anything that they even thought of. So, I think confidence would initially break, but longer term, it is good for confidence because it will be a sign that the rule of law is coming back to the United States.\u201dHolter contends the politics of crooked Washington D.C. have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar. Holter says, \u201cOne reason I think the dollars has been weak since the beginning of 2017 is there were an awful lot of truth bombs that hit last year. There is more truth with this four page memo from Congress that was just voted to be released. Foreigners are looking at the dollar with high skepticism because all of this \u2018truth\u2019 points to a very crooked, fraudulent and corrupt nation. Do you really want your assets in that system and denominated in that currency? I think the answer is no, and that\u2019s one of the reasons you are seeing the huge devaluation of the dollar. . . . In 2017, my theme was that was the year of the truth bomb, and in 2018, I believe the theme will end up being the year that truth finally mattered.\u201d", "is_fake": 1},

Before it\u2019s over, America is going to be shown evidence that the FBI and DOJ not only committed crimes against an incoming President to try and get him kicked out of office, but massive crimes against other politicians it did not approve of. The evidence will likely include spying on millions of Americans, and that will shake the Republic. It will also send many traitors to the Constitution to jail. The calm before the storm is over, and expect some wild things coming to America.I have said the good news about the economy is the President is going to be successful. The latest good news in the Trump economy is a projected 5.4% GDP rate. That\u2019s twice the GDP in any year of the Obama Administration. The bad news about the President is he\u2019s also going to be successful, and that is finally going send interest rates higher. Can that cause big problems in the financial markets? You bet, and this bubble may finally have its long anticipated pop.The NFL is holding its annual Super Bowl.

It was a year ago, about this time, when the predominate story was \u201cking dollar.\u201d The dollar was going to soar and all this kind of jazz. Last year (2017), it looked like it was breaking out, and it got to 103 (on the USDX). Instead, it fell by 10% and, so far this year, it\u2019s already down about 3%, and here we are just in early February. It\u2019s not straight down. It\u2019s probably not going to plunge in 2018 as fast as it rose in 2014, but anyone can take a look at a chart and see it\u2019s going down. This has significant implications for this year and going into next year. If it was disinflation on the way up, it will be inflation on the way down.\u201d", "is_fake": 1},

What in the heck is going on? Schiff explains, \u201cThe real question is what was going on when the markets were going up? That\u2019s what made no sense. The fact that they are coming back down to earth makes a lot more sense. I think the catalyst for this move (in the stock market) is, ironically, the tax cuts we got because that put the bigger deficits in the spotlight. Now, the deficits are going to go off the charts because we have to replace the lost tax revenue with more debt.\u201dWhat about the economy improving under Trump? Schiff says, \u201cGrowth hasn\u2019t really picked up, it\u2019s actually slower. This is all nonsense. The economy is not improving. Nothing is happening other than we are going into huge debt. We got tax cuts, and we borrowed the money to pay for them.\u201dSchiff predicts in the next recession, the Fed will go back to printing even more money. Schiff contends, \u201cThere is no question in my mind because the alternative is politically unacceptable to anybody, which would be a worse financial crisis than 2008. When we go back into recession, when we are in a bear market, they are going to go back to the only formula that they think works. They can\u2019t do rate cuts because rates are so low, they can really cut them very much. So, the only real stimulus they can reach for is QE (money printing), but it\u2019s not going to work this time. We are going to overdose on QE. There are no more bubbles that they can blow. They have already blown the mother of all bubbles, and this is it. There is no more. So, I think when they launch QE4, they get a currency crisis. We get a sovereign debt crisis. That is where we are headed. It\u2019s taken a long time to get there, and because of that, the problem has gotten so much bigger. The bubble got so much bigger, so it\u2019s going to be much more disruptive.\u201d", "is_fake": 1},
